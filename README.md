# Web3Torrent: Complete Business Model & Protocol Overview

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

Web3Torrent is a **decentralized content licensing, distribution, and anti-piracy enforcement platform** that revolutionizes digital content monetization. Built as an evolution of the original [State Channels Web3Torrent](https://blog.statechannels.org/introducing-web3torrent/), this system combines incentivized P2P file sharing with comprehensive copyright protection through blockchain-verified licensing and crowdsourced enforcement.

- Set pricing strategy (flat rate or auction-based)
- Collect licensing revenue and fund bounty hunter rewards
- Maintain hands-off approach to content management

### 📡 **Distributors** 
**Role**: Licensed content distributors and P2P network participants
- Purchase one-time licenses (with optional expiration/renewal)
- Distribute content across multiple platforms (YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
- Earn revenue from platform ad revenue
- Participate in P2P network as both downloaders and uploaders
- Must register all publishing locations on-chain

### 🕵️ **Bounty Hunters**
**Role**: Decentralized copyright enforcement agents
- Continuously scan all major platforms for unauthorized content
- Cross-reference against blockchain registry of licensed distributors
- Submit zkTLS proofs for copyright takedowns
- Earn proportional rewards from bounty pool

### 💰 **Downloaders**
**Role**: End consumers accessing content
- Pay flat access fee + small uploader fee
- Gain access to licensed content via torrent network
- Contribute to distributor rebate system through fees

## 🔄 **Complete System Flow**

### **Phase 1: Content Publication**
```
Publisher → Creates torrent magnet link
         → Chooses pricing model (flat rate/auction)
         → Sets bounty pool allocation percentage
         → Deploys smart contract with licensing terms
```

### **Phase 2: License Acquisition**
```
Distributor → Pays licensing fee (flat rate or auction bid)
           → Gains access to torrent magnet link
           → Recorded as licensed distributor on-chain
           → Receives distribution rights and instructions
```

### **Phase 3: Content Distribution**
```
Distributor → Downloads content via P2P network
           → Uploads to multiple streaming platforms
           → Registers each platform publication on-chain
           → Earns ad revenue from platform monetization
           → Continues seeding in P2P network for rebates
```

### **Phase 4: P2P Network Participation**
```
Distributor → Acts as seeder in torrent network
           → Earns rebates based on:
             • Total uploaded bandwidth
             • Number of unique peers served
           → Rebates funded by downloader access fees
```

### **Phase 5: Copyright Enforcement**
```
Bounty Hunter → Scans platforms for unauthorized content
              → Cross-checks against licensed distributor registry
              → Identifies unauthorized publications
              → Submits zkTLS proof of takedown
              → Receives proportional reward from bounty pool
```

## 💰 **Economic Model**

### **Revenue Streams**

| Participant | Revenue Source | Mechanism |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Publisher** | Licensing fees | Flat rate or auction-based sales |
| **Publisher** | Viral content premiums | Dynamic pricing for trending content |
| **Distributor** | Platform ad revenue | YouTube, Spotify, etc. monetization |
| **Distributor** | P2P rebates | Fees from downloaders based on upload activity |
| **Bounty Hunter** | Takedown rewards | Proportional share of bounty pool |

### **Fee Structure**

| Fee Type | Source | Destination | Purpose |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Licensing Fee** | Distributor → Publisher | Publisher wallet | Content access rights |
| **Network Fee** | Distributor → System | Seeding distributors | Rebates for P2P uploading/seeding |
| **Bounty Allocation** | License purchases | Bounty pool | Fund copyright enforcement |

### **Network Fee Distribution**
When a distributor purchases a license, they pay:
- **Licensing Fee** → Goes directly to the publisher
- **Network Fee** → Goes into a rebate pool for distributors who seed the content

The Network Fee is distributed proportionally to seeding distributors based on:
- **Uploaded bandwidth contributed** to the torrent swarm
- **Number of unique peers served**

Since only licensed distributors can access the content initially, the seeders earning rebates are typically other distributors who previously purchased licenses and are now contributing to the P2P network.

## 🔐 **Smart Contract Architecture**

### **Core Contract Responsibilities**
- **License Registry**: Track all licensed distributors with timestamps and terms
- **Platform Registry**: Merkle-based registry linking distributors to their publishing platforms
- **Auction System**: Handle dynamic pricing for viral content
- **Bounty Management**: Accept zkTLS proofs and distribute rewards proportionally
- **Rebate Calculation**: Track P2P activity and calculate distributor earnings
- **ZK Verification**: Validate bounty hunter takedown proofs

### **Data Structures**
```solidity
struct License {
    address distributor;
    uint256 purchasePrice;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bool isActive;
    uint256 expirationDate; // optional
}

struct PlatformRegistration {
    address distributor;
    string platform;
    string contentId;
    bytes32 merkleProof;
}

struct BountySubmission {
    address hunter;
    string platform;
    string contentId;
    bytes zkTLSProof;
    bool verified;
    uint256 timestamp;
}
```

## 🛡️ **Anti-Piracy System**

### **Detection Mechanism**
1. **Continuous Scanning**: Bounty hunters monitor all major platforms
2. **Registry Cross-Check**: Compare found content against licensed distributor database
3. **Unauthorized Identification**: Flag content without valid distributor linkage
4. **Proof Submission**: Submit zkTLS proof of unauthorized content and takedown

### **zkTLS Proof Requirements**
- **Platform Access Proof**: Cryptographic evidence of accessing the platform
- **Content Existence Proof**: Verification that the content was present
- **Takedown Proof**: Evidence that a copyright takedown was successfully executed
- **Non-Repudiation**: Tamper-proof evidence that can be verified on-chain

### **Reward Distribution**
```
Bounty Pool = Σ(License Purchases × Bounty Percentage)
Hunter Reward = (Hunter Takedowns / Total Takedowns) × Bounty Pool
```
