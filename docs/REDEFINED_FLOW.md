This forms a **robust Web3-native licensing, distribution, and anti-piracy enforcement protocol**. Here‚Äôs a more formalized summary of your updated business logic and how all parts interact:

---

## üß† **Refined Web3 Content Distribution Protocol**

### üîπ **Core Roles:**

| Role              | Purpose                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Publisher**     | Uploads content, issues licenses, collects licensing and auction fees.   |
| **Distributor**   | Buys license, distributes to platforms, earns ad revenue.                |
| **Bounty Hunter** | Scans for unauthorized uploads, submits zkTLS proof for takedown reward. |

---

### üì¶ **Publisher Flow:**

* Uploads torrent magnet link (with instructional/license file).
* Chooses pricing model:

  * **Flat rate** licensing fee.
  * **Auction-based** licensing (dynamic market price).
* License validity: **One-time** (with optional expiration/renewal).
* Each sale sets aside a portion of the fee in a **Bounty Pool**.
* Licensees (distributors) are **logged on-chain**.

---

### üì° **Distributor Flow:**

* Pays the licensing fee to gain access.
* Authorized to distribute the content on:

  * YouTube, Spotify, etc.
* Revenue model:

  * Earns ad revenue from each platform they upload to.
* **Incentivized to publish widely** to maximize revenue.
* Must **submit proof of distribution** to a registry (platform + distributor address).

  * Ensures **Bounty Hunters don‚Äôt misflag** their content.
  * Could be cryptographic commitments + platform metadata.

---

### üïµÔ∏è **Bounty Hunter Flow:**

* Constantly scans platforms for content related to published torrents.
* For any **unauthorized upload**:

  * Cross-check against smart contract registry of licensees.
  * If no valid license exists, flag it.
* Must submit a **zkTLS proof** showing:

  * They accessed the platform.
  * The content existed.
  * A takedown was triggered.
* If validated:

  * They are **rewarded proportionally** from the Bounty Pool.

---

### üí∏ **Reward Distribution Logic:**

| Pool                    | Funded By                            | Distributed To                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Publisher Revenue**   | From licensing and auctions          | Publisher wallet                              |
| **Distributor Rebates** | From downloader access fees          | Based on upload activity                      |
| **Bounty Pool**         | From each license purchase (fixed %) | Bounty Hunters based on valid takedown shares |

---

## üîê Smart Contract Responsibilities

* Track all licensed distributors and their associated uploads/platforms.
* Store auction/bid logic and license expirations.
* Maintain a Merkle-based registry for platforms linked to each distributor.
* Accept zkTLS proof from Bounty Hunters (verify via ZK Verifier contract).
* Distribute bounty rewards by:

  * Calculating total valid takedowns per Hunter.
  * Splitting the bounty pool proportionally.
