A **hybrid of decentralized content distribution, tokenized incentives, and off-chain anti-piracy enforcement**.

Here’s how all the components tie together:

---

## 🌐 **System Flow Summary**

### 1. **📤 Publish**

* A **Publisher** creates a torrent magnet link with:

  * The main content
  * Instructional or licensing details
* To access the link, users must:

  * Pay a **flat access fee**
  * Pay a **small uploader fee** (goes to Distributors/seeders)

---

### 2. **♻️ Distributors**

* These are **verified downloaders + uploaders**.
* They:

  * Pay to access the torrent
  * Begin **uploading to others**, earning fee rebates
* **Rebate amount is variable**, based on:

  * Total **uploaded bandwidth**
  * Total **number of unique peers** uploaded to

📜 **Smart Contract** tracks:

* Which addresses purchased access
* Upload stats and peer logs
* Distributor performance to determine rebate eligibility

---

### 3. **📺 Streaming Platforms (External)**

* Not part of the torrent network.
* Represent **unauthorized vectors** like:

  * YouTube
  * Spotify
  * Apple Music
* These platforms are not in the system, but are **scanned** by external watchers.

---

### 4. **🕵️ Bounty Hunters**

* Continuously **scan public platforms**.
* Cross-check content with the smart contract’s list of **licensed distributors**.
* When a **match is found** (a known torrent is uploaded, but not by a verified distributor):

  * It’s flagged as **unauthorized**
  * A **bounty submission** is made on-chain
  * The proof might include: platform link, time, signature, etc.

💰 **Bounty Fee Pool**:

* Funded from **licensing revenue** collected by the publisher.
* Shared proportionally across all bounty hunters **based on their contribution volume** (e.g. # of verified unique takedown proofs).

## 🔄 Economic Loops

| Role              | Action                                     | Reward Mechanism                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Publisher**     | Publishes content & manages licensing      | Earns flat fees + licensing sales            |
| **Distributor**   | Downloads + uploads content (pays upfront) | Gets partial rebate from uploader fees       |
| **Downloader**    | Pays to access torrent                     | Gains access to licensed content             |
| **Bounty Hunter** | Scans web platforms for unlicensed content | Gets a % of licensing revenue (if validated) |

## 🔐 Smart Contract Responsibilities

* **Track licensed distributors** (who paid, when, how much)
* **Record distributor uploads** (can be reported via external attestation or proofs)
* **Manage rebate calculations**
* **Accept bounty submissions**
* **Distribute bounty rewards proportionally**
* Possibly interact with decentralized storage (e.g. IPFS, Filecoin)
